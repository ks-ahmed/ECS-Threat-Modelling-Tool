# ECS Threat Modelling Tool â€“ End-to-End DevSecOps on AWS

Welcome to the **Threat Modelling Tool**, a fully containerized web application deployed securely on **AWS ECS (Fargate)** with end-to-end infrastructure automation using **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions**. Built for scalability, security, and automation â€“ this project represents a production-grade DevSecOps pipeline with modern cloud architecture.

## CI/CD Workflow Overview

All workflows are modular and triggered via `workflow_dispatch` or `push`. Built for auditability, safety, and repeatability.

### Build & Push Docker Image
```yaml
Trigger: push to main / manual dispatch
Steps:
- Checkout Code
- Login to AWS ECR
- Build & Tag Docker Image
- Push to ECR
```

# Terraform Init

`Trigger: Manual
Steps:
- Configure AWS Credentials
- Terraform init (infrastructure bootstrapping)`


# Terraform Plan

`Trigger: Manual
Steps:
- Plan infra changes using latest ECR image
- Show preview before apply`

# Terraform Apply

`Trigger: Manual
Steps:
- Apply infra changes (ECS service, ALB, ACM, etc.)`

# Terraform Destroy

`Trigger: Manual
Steps:
- Clean up all AWS resources`


# How to Use (For Reviewers)

  - Clone the repo
  - Update terraform.tfvars or GitHub secrets
  - Trigger CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions
  - Access the app at: https://tm.vettlyai.com

# Why This Project?

 - This project was built to simulate a real-world deployment scenario for a secure web application using DevOps best practices. It demonstrates:
 - Hands-on mastery of AWS infrastructure
 - Deep understanding of Terraform and modular design
 - CI/CD integration with Docker, GitHub Actions, and ECR
 - Attention to production-grade security (TLS, IAM, DNS)
